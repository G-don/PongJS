##Description

Pong is simply one of the greatest games of all time! It was a challenge to create this clone of Pong and I can't beat the computer. I made it so hard that if you score a point it is a win! Being such a fan of Attari, this was a good project that kept me busy all the time, really seeing what was under the hood and how we could make the game harder or easier! I spent a lot of hours playing and testing to get the best experience. However, as this is one of my first projects after learning Javascript with online tutorials, it still lacks some features like having a start button.

##Instructions

If you are cloning this project, you will need

1 - VsCode with live server extension.

2 - Go live 

3 - Move the paddle with your mouse. 

4 - This is a non stop game! ')

##Features

Feel free to play and let me know the final score if you want to test your skills against an unbeatable computer player!

##Visuals

To help you better understand the flow and functionality of Pong, I have included a package of screenshots and a video. These visuals will give you an insight into the application's interface and guide you through its features.
